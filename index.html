<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h2>

<p>We want to be able to collect collaboration signals for hackathons by building an online hackathon tool that supports project workspaces.  During work this spring we built the basic framework for project disclosure, reviews,  and event summarization but in order to obtain data on individual and project performance as well as group collaboration we would need workspaces that support online meetings (Google Hangouts), chat (IRC), and code (git and pull request discussions).  </p>

<p>This would focus effort directly on running hackathons that are completely virtual rather than the in person hackathons that are currently supported by applications.  However, for this summer some of the core functionality that would need to be present for large-scale deployment (dynamic scheduling, initial project vetting, and team formation recommendations) would not be a top priority. The focus would be on prototyping the tools for collecting and analysing the data on collaboration from the workspace. </p>

<p>The long-term goal of this effort is triggering system processes for automated resource allocation and collaboration at large scale.</p>

<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h2>

<p>Weâ€™ll be looking at syncing up weekly. </p>

<ul>
<li>Start of September should have the core systems in place for monitoring collaboration signals in Google Hangouts</li>
<li>Start of October should see operationalized systems for persisting collaboration data as well as visualization</li>
<li>CALIHack 2016 next spring is tentatively set as the first large-scale online hackathon that would use the tool</li>
<li>Smaller hackathons, including<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Create Personal Identity Accounts with OAuth2</p>

<p>Create Project Workspaces (Google Hangouts, GitHub, chat)</p>

<p>Models supporting online hackathon: User, Event, Workspace, Project, Role, Rating</p>

<p>Twitter Ratings</p>
